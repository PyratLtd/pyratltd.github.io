Pyrat Ltd was originally created when Xan faced redundancy in his role as a
Systems/DevOps Engineer and was investigating contracting roles. In February
2017, Xan found full time permanent employment and Pyrat Ltd remained a domant
company having never traded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A number of accounts had already been registered under the &amp;ldquo;Pyrat&amp;rdquo; name and
became a brand for which Xan publishes code, for example
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://pyrat.engineering/">PyratLabs&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; on GitHub contains a number of free
and open source projects published for consumption by the community. Projects
will typically focus on Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automation and
configuration management.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
